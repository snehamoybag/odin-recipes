    <li>2 ½ tablespoons coconut oil</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces</li>
    <li>2 whole star anise pods</li>
    <li>4 cardamom pods</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon whole cloves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons curry leaves, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 small tomato, diced</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground paprika</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Season goat meat with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, and black
      pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Place red onions in a blender; grind into a smooth paste.</li>
    <li>
      Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
      cinnamon stick, star anise, and cardamom pods; cook until aromatic,
      about 30 seconds. Add fennel and cloves; cook and stir for 30 seconds.
      Add remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon curry leaves; stir in the
      onion paste. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook and stir curry mixture
      for 5 minutes; add ginger-garlic paste and continue cooking until
      flavors meld, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir diced tomato into the curry mixture. Cook and stir until mushy,
      about 4 minutes. Add the seasoned goat meat; cook until browned, 6 to 10
      minutes. Transfer goat curry to a slow cooker; cook on High until meat
      is tender, 2 to 3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and
      stir the remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, garam masala, curry powder,
      and paprika until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add a few cups of the curry
      from the slow cooker; heat until oil rises to the top. Add remaining 1
      tablespoon curry leaves and cilantro; cook until gravy thickens, 3 to 5
      minutes. Pour back into the slow cooker and blend well.
