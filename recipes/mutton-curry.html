      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground paprika</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season goat meat with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, and black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Place red onions in a blender; grind into a smooth paste.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
        cinnamon stick, star anise, and cardamom pods; cook until aromatic,
        about 30 seconds. Add fennel and cloves; cook and stir for 30 seconds.
        Add remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon curry leaves; stir in the
        onion paste. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook and stir curry mixture
        for 5 minutes; add ginger-garlic paste and continue cooking until
        flavors meld, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir diced tomato into the curry mixture. Cook and stir until mushy,
        about 4 minutes. Add the seasoned goat meat; cook until browned, 6 to 10
        minutes. Transfer goat curry to a slow cooker; cook on High until meat
        is tender, 2 to 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and
        stir the remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, garam masala, curry powder,
        and paprika until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add a few cups of the curry
        from the slow cooker; heat until oil rises to the top. Add remaining 1
        tablespoon curry leaves and cilantro; cook until gravy thickens, 3 to 5
        minutes. Pour back into the slow cooker and blend well.
