# Odin Project - Recipe Site

In this project I got to put my HTML knowledge into practice.

This is a simple 3 page recipe site where each page holds a recipe of some of my favorite dishes.
Each recipe page consists of a image of the dish, a small description about the diesh/recipe, an undored list of ingredients and an ordered list for the steps to follow.

The recipe pages can be accessed from the homepage (index.html).
